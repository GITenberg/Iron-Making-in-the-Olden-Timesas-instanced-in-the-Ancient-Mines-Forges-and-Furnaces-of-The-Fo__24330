<p>The remarkable revival and development that has recently taken place in
the Iron Works of the Forest of Dean, and the consequent improvement which
has accrued to the district, proves conclusively that its condition and
prospects are largely dependent upon such manufacture.&nbsp; Impressed with
this fact, it has occurred to the Author that a more particular account of
them than has been given in his former work on the Forest might prove
interesting to the numerous individuals with whom they are connected.</p>
<p>For several years past this subject has been upon his mind, during which
time he has fully availed himself of the contents of the Forestal Archives
belonging to the Middle Ages, and appropriated all the information, as he
believes, which the neighbourhood itself affords.</p>
<p>He respectfully submits the produce to the perusal of those gentlemen
and friends who may favour these pages with their attention.</p>
<p>In coming before them for the third time, he cannot retire from so
interesting a neighbourhood without requesting them to consider this as his
final mark of appreciation and gratitude for the invariable kindness they
have so long shown him.</p>

<p>If there be one circumstance more than another that has conferred
celebrity on the Forest of Dean, it is <i>the remote origin</i>,
<i>perpetuation</i>, <i>and invariably high repute of its iron
works</i>.&nbsp; Uniting these characteristics in one, it probably
surpasses every other spot in Great Britain.</p>
<p>In the author&rsquo;s former &ldquo;historical account&rdquo; of this
neighbourhood, he gave all the information he had then collected relative
to the mining and making of iron therein.&nbsp; Since that time, he has
greatly extended his investigations, especially <a name="citation1"></a><a
href="#footnote1" class="citation">[1]</a> amongst the records of the Court
of Exchequer.&nbsp; The result is, that he believes he is now enabled to
present to the public the most complete description that has yet appeared
of the manufacture of iron during the Middle Ages, detailing, in the first
place, all the particulars he has gathered of the operations of the
primitive miner, or iron worker, and <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>proceeding, in
chronological order, to the present time.</p>
<p>In the year 1780, wrote Mr. Wyrrall, in his valuable MS. on the ancient
iron works of the Forest:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There are, deep in the earth, vast caverns scooped out by
men&rsquo;s hands, and large as the aisles of churches; and on its surface
are extensive labyrinths worked among the rocks, and now long since
overgrown with woods, which whosoever traces them must see with
astonishment, and incline to think them to have been the work of armies
rather than of private labourers.&nbsp; They certainly were the toil of
many centuries, and this perhaps before they thought of searching in the
bowels of the earth for their ore&mdash;whither, however, they at length
naturally pursued the veins, as they found them to be exhausted near the
surface.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such were the remains, as they existed in his day, of the original iron
mines of this locality; and, except where modern operations have
obliterated them, such they continue to the present time.</p>
<p>The fact of their presenting no trace of engineering skill, or of the
use of any kind of machinery, is conclusive of their remote
antiquity.&nbsp; Nor are there any traces of gunpowder having been employed
in them; but this, Mr. John Taylor says, was not resorted to for such
purposes earlier than 1620, when some German miners, brought over by Prince
Rupert, used it at Ecton, in Staffordshire.</p>
<p>It is the unanimous opinion of the neighbourhood that these caves owe
their origin to the predecessors of that peculiar order of operatives known
as &ldquo;the free miners of the Forest of Dean;&rdquo; a view which the
authentic history of the district confirms.</p>
<p>They have the appearance either of spacious caves, as above Lydney and
on the Doward Hill, or of deep <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>stone quarries, as at the Scowles, near
Bream.&nbsp; Or they consist of precipitous and irregularly shaped
passages, left by the removal of the ore or mineral earth wherever it was
found, and which was followed down, in some instances, for many hundreds of
yards.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p3.jpg">
<img alt="Ancient Mine Work near Bream" src="images/p3.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Openings were made to the surface according as the course of the
mine-ore permitted, being softer to work than the limestone rock that
contained it, thus securing efficient ventilation.&nbsp; Hence, although
they have been so long deserted, the air in them is perfectly good.&nbsp;
They are also quite dry&mdash;owing, probably, to their being drained by
the new workings <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>adjacent to them, and descending to a far greater depth.</p>
<p>In the first place, they were excavated as far down, no doubt, as the
water permitted; that is, to a vertical depth of about 100 yards, or, in
dry seasons, even lower, as may be seen by the watermarks left in some of
them.&nbsp; Of these deeper workings, one of the most extensive occurs on
the Lining Wood Hill, above Mitcheldean, and is well worth exploring.&nbsp;
They are met with, however, on most sides of the Forest&mdash;in fact,
wherever the ore crops out, giving the name of &ldquo;meand,&rdquo; or
mine, to such places.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, those spots where the ore lay exposed to view, would
be apt to secure the notice of the earlier miners, and become the site of
their more ancient workings.&nbsp; Not until they were pretty nearly
exhausted would the severer labour involved in the lower diggings be
resorted to.&nbsp; The shallower but more capacious mine holes appear with
greater frequency on the south and west sides of the Forest, where, too,
they were nearer to the water carriage of the Severn and the Wye.&nbsp; In
most instances they are locally termed &ldquo;scowles,&rdquo; a corruption,
perhaps, of the British word &ldquo;crowll,&rdquo; meaning cave.&nbsp;
Occasionally they are found adorned with beautiful incrustations of the
purest white, formed by springs of carbonate of lime, originating in the
rocky walls of limestone around.&nbsp; Sometimes, after proceeding for a
considerable distance closely confined in height and width, they suddenly
open out into spacious vaults, fifteen feet each way, the site, probably,
of some valuable &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; or &ldquo;churn&rdquo; of ore; and
then again, where the <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>supply was less abundant, narrowing into a width
hardly sufficient to admit the human body.&nbsp; Now and then, the passage
divides and unites again, or abruptly stops, turning off at a sharp angle,
or, changing its level, shows rude steps cut in the rock, by which the old
miners ascended or descended.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p5.jpg">
<img alt="Ancient Miners&rsquo; Ladder" src="images/p5.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In some of these places, ladders, made out of hewn oak planks, with
holes chopped through them for the feet, have been discovered.&nbsp;
Mattocks, such as masons use, have likewise been met with, as well as oak
shovels for collecting the ore.&nbsp; Shoe prints, and even <!-- page
6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>shoe-leathers have
also been found, although the latter are supposed to have been seldom used,
judging from the more frequent occurrence of naked foot marks.&nbsp; Long
immersion in the chalybeate water of the mine has blackened the oak, and
corroded the iron; nevertheless, these relics are surprisingly
perfect.&nbsp; The new road over the Plump Hill exposed in its formation,
in 1841, an ancient mine hole, in which was found a heap of half-consumed
embers, and the skull of what appeared, from its tusks, to be that of a
wild boar; the remains, perhaps, of a feast given by our Forest
ancestors.&nbsp; Similar vestiges have been met with in other spots.</p>

<p>The earliest historical allusions to these underground works is made by
Camden, who records that a gigantic skeleton was found in a cave on the
Great Doward Hill, now called &ldquo;King Arthur&rsquo;s Hall,&rdquo; <!--
page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>being
evidently the entrance to an ancient iron mine.&nbsp; The next refers to
the period of the great rebellion, when the terrified inhabitants of the
district are said to have fled to them for safety, when pursued by the
troops with which the Forest was infested.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

/>
</a></p>
<p>But, whilst no previous mention of these caverns is to be found, nor
dates anywhere inscribed on their rocky walls, a clue, as to when and by
whom they were first wrought, is given in connection with their metallic
products, that abound near them in the state of iron cinders.&nbsp; Thus it
is recorded by Mr. Wyrrall, in his MS. description of this subject,
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Coins, fibul&aelig;, and other things, known to be in use with
the Romans, have been frequently found in the beds of cinders at certain
places.&nbsp; This has occurred particularly at the village of Whitchurch,
between Ross and Monmouth, where large stacks of cinders have been found,
some of them eight or ten feet under the surface, and demonstrating,
without other proof, that they must have lain there for a great number of
ages.&nbsp; The writer had opportunities of seeing many of these coins and
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>fibul&aelig;, &amp;c., which have been picked up by the workmen in
getting the cinders, in his time; but especially one coin of Trajan, which
he remembers was surprisingly perfect, considering the length of time it
must have been in the ground.&nbsp; Another instance occurs to his
recollection of a little image of brass, about four inches long, which was
then found in the cinders in the same place, being a very elegant female
figure in a dancing attitude, and evidently antique by the
drapery.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Numerous other Roman vestiges, on every side of the Forest, may be
adverted to.&nbsp; No great distance from Whitchurch, and immediately
adjoining this neighbourhood on the north, is the site of Ariconium, marked
by numerous traces of the hardware manufacture of that people.&nbsp; Near
Lydney and Tidenham, discoveries of Roman relics have been extensively
made.&nbsp; At Lydbrook, and on the Coppet Wood Hill, at Perry Grove, and
Crabtree Hill, all within or near the Forest&mdash;the last being situated
in the middle of it&mdash;many coins of Philip, Gallienus, Victorinus, and
of Claudius Gothicus, have been brought to light.&nbsp; We possess
indisputable testimony, from Mr. Lower&rsquo;s researches in the old
iron-making parts of Sussex, that the Romans there carried on metallurgical
operations at an early period, and we may claim a like antiquity for our
Dean Forest workings.&nbsp; An examination of the cinder-heaps that still
occur, especially in the precincts of the mines already described, reveals,
beyond doubt, the antecedents of the mineral operations of the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Considering the <i>extent</i> of the excavations from whence these
metallic relics were procured, it is not surprising that these mounds of
slag continue to be constantly met with.&nbsp; Two hundred years ago, they
<!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>were of
course much more abundant, having formed since that period a large part of
the supply to the iron furnaces of this district.&nbsp; They are yet
numerous enough to catch the eye wherever the observer may direct his
steps, either along the retired lane, or in the secluded valley.&nbsp; The
fields and orchards, gardens and precincts of the Forest villages, are
nearly sure to contain them.&nbsp; Two localities, viz. Cinderford and
Cinderhill, no doubt derive their names from them.&nbsp; In some places
they have proved so abundant as to have enhanced the value of the land
containing them.&nbsp; They even occur on elevated spots, exposed to every
wind, and remote from human habitations.&nbsp; Nor is their existence to be
limited to the Forest, or even to the Gloucestershire side of the Wye,
since the Rev. T. W. Webb states&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In many parts of the district of Irchinfield, in Herefordshire,
cinders are found in the road, or dispersed in the fields; and in many
places heaps of them have been discovered.&nbsp; I would particularly
specify the parishes of Tretire with Michaelchurch, Peterstow, great heaps
at St. Weonards, and Llangarren.&nbsp; In the last century, enormous heaps
were found at considerable depth in &lsquo;the Brook End,&rsquo; a street
of Ross.&nbsp; Near Rudhall, the roads were repaired with them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their <i>character</i> is peculiar, exhibiting by no means complete
fusion, but rather semi-vitrifaction by roasting; the ore retaining, not
unfrequently, a large measure of its original weight and form, explained,
as Dr. Percy kindly informs me, by charcoal being the fuel employed, and
not necessarily arising from want of skill in the operatives.&nbsp; They
are said to vary in richness according as they belong <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>to an earlier or later
period&mdash;so much so, that some persons have ventured, on this data, to
specify their respective ages; but other causes may have produced this
difference.&nbsp; They exhibit, however, some slight variation of
character, indicative, it may be&mdash;for so Mr. Wyrrall
considered&mdash;of relative age, according as they are found to have left
in them less or more of the metallic element.</p>
<p>It is impossible to mistake them for common cinders; nor do they
resemble the slag of the modern smelting furnace.&nbsp; In fact, they are
<i>sui generis</i>, and can only be met with where the manufacture of iron
was anciently carried on.</p>
<p>Though the constant occurrence of wood embers with the old cinders is
conclusive proof that charcoal was the fuel invariably used, yet how it was
employed can hardly be determined with exactness, except from what is known
of the elementary plans in early use amongst other people, the Egyptians,
for instance, the natives of Central Africa, or the iron-workers of
Madagascar.&nbsp; A strong draught must necessarily have been made to pass
through the ignited fuel, either by placing the furnace so as to take the
wind, or by forming it on the principle of the modern wind furnace.&nbsp;
Or the required blast might have been created by means of wooden cylinders,
or leathern bags, alternately compressed by the hands or feet.&nbsp;
Water-power was rarely, if ever, resorted to at this remote date, since
cinders are seldom found near brooks or streams.</p>
<p>In common with everything else relating to the manufactures of the
kingdom, Domesday Book is silent respecting the mines, iron works, and
miners <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>of the Forest.&nbsp; Adverting, however, to this otherwise
invaluable return, we learn from it that Edward the Confessor was
accustomed to demand from the citizens of Gloucester, &ldquo;thirty-six
dicres of iron, and a hundred elongated iron rods for bolts for the
king&rsquo;s ships,&rdquo;&mdash;(xxxvi. dicras ferri &amp; c. virgas
ferreas ductiles ad clavos navium Regis).&nbsp; The nearest, and indeed,
the only locality, within a distance of many miles, from whence the
forgemen of Gloucester could have obtained their iron, was this
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Hence the metal they used came from the Forest.</p>
<p>Less than a hundred years later, and all doubt on this point is removed
by a notification in the Great Rolls of the Pipe, that 16s. worth of iron
was sent, in 1158, to Wudestock (Woodstock) by the king&rsquo;s order,
besides 8s. worth more for repairs at his palace.&nbsp; An observation of
Geraldus, describing the tour he made through Wales in 1188, speaks of the
&ldquo;noble Forest of Dean, by which Gloucester was amply supplied with
iron and venison.&rdquo; <a name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a></p>
<p>The first charter granted to the Abbey of Flaxley, by Henry II., whilst
Duke of Normandy, and therefore previous to 1154, in which year he came to
the throne, specifies an iron work at Edlaud, now Elton, near Westbury, on
the eastern side of the Forest. <a name="citation11b"></a><a
href="#footnote11b" class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; His second charter,
when king, is more explicit, and describes &ldquo;an iron forge, free and
quit, with as free liberty to work as any of his forges in demesne,&rdquo;
showing that he possessed several.&nbsp; <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>The allowance of two
oaks per week, wherewith the monks might feed their forge, although not
mentioned until 42 Henry III. (1258), when they were commuted for the tract
of land yet called the Abbot&rsquo;s Woods, were granted most likely at
this period, and afford some data for determining the capacity of the
Flaxley works.</p>
<p>At the commencement of his reign (1216), Henry III. commanded
&ldquo;John de Monmouth to cause Richard de Eston to have his forge working
in the Forest of Dean, at Staunton, according to the Charter of Henry
II.&rdquo; <a name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a></p>
<p>In the same year, &ldquo;the Constable of St. Briavell is ordered to
remove, without delay, all forges from the Forest of Dean, except the
King&rsquo;s demesne forges, which belong to the Castle of St. Briavell,
and ought to be sustained with trunks and old trees wherever they are found
in the demesnes in the Forest&mdash;excepting two forges belonging to Ralph
Avenell, concerning which he has the charter of King John, and excepting
four &lsquo;Blissahiis;&rsquo; Will. de Dene, &amp; Robert de Alba Mara,
&amp; Will. de Abbenhale, &amp; Thomas de Blakencia, and excepting the
forges of our servants of St. Briavells, which ought to be sustained with
dry and dead wood.&rdquo; <a name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a></p>
<p>Under date 4 Henry III. (1220), &ldquo;John de Monmouth is commanded not
to permit any forge to work, either with green or dry wood, in the Forest
of Dean, besides the demesne forges; and to let all those know who have had
forges, and who claim to have them by charter or letters patent of our (the
<!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>king&rsquo;s) ancestors, or our special precepts, that they are to
come without delay before H. de Burg, our justiciary, and our counsel, with
those letters and charters, that it may be known who may have forges and
who may not.&rdquo; <a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a></p>
<p>The inference to be drawn from such prohibitory investigations is, that,
owing to the remunerative character of the Forest iron works, they had
become undesirably numerous, causing an inexpedient waste of the adjoining
woods, besides hampering the rights of the Crown.</p>
<p>An immediate effect ensued, as the following memoranda show:&mdash;</p>
<p>In the same year as aforesaid, &ldquo;John de Monmouth is commanded to
permit the Abbot and Monks of Flaxlegh to have their forge working in the
Forest of Dean, according to the charter of Richard I. (which they have
thereof), in the same manner as they had it in the time of King John,
notwithstanding that all forges are prohibited in the Forest except the
demesne forges.&rdquo; <a name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b"
class="citation">[13b]</a></p>
<p>In the same year, John de Monmouth is commanded &ldquo;to permit Walter
de Lacy to have his forge (fabrica) in the Forest of Dean as he was
accustomed to have it, temp. Hen. II. and John, which was prohibited at the
time of our general prohibition.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, also, John de Monmouth
received the king&rsquo;s directions as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;William
Fitz-Warren has shown the king that whereas Walter de Lacy gave him a
forge, which the said Walter and his ancestors have been accustomed to
have, temp. Hen. II., Ric. I., <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>and John, and which was prohibited in our
general prohibition&mdash;we command you to allow the said William to have
the said forge (fabrica) moveable in the Forest; but that the forge which
the said Walter erected without our order shall remain quiet (remanenta
otiosa).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next year, 1221, John de Monmouth is ordered to allow Philip de
Bantun, Rob. de Alba Mara, John de Lacy, Will. de Dene, Will de Abbenhale,
and Thomas de Blakeney, foresters of fee in the Forest of Dean, and Nigell
Hathway, Martin de la Boze, John Fitz-Hugh, Richard Wither, Rob.
Fitz-Warren, Will. Cadel, John Blund, Alexander de Staurs, Roger Wither,
John Fitz-Gadway, serventes de feods, to have their &ldquo;forgias
itinerantes ad mortuum et siccum&rdquo; as they were accustomed to have
them temp. Ric. I. and John. <a name="citation14a"></a><a
href="#footnote14a" class="citation">[14a]</a>&nbsp; A similar privilege
was granted, the same year, to Matilda de Cautilupe and Henry, Earl of
Warwick&mdash;the latter at Lidenie&mdash;to have their
&ldquo;forgia,&rdquo; as well as to Walter de Aure to have his
&ldquo;forgia itinerans,&rdquo; and Richd. de Estun his
&ldquo;fabrica.&rdquo; <a name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a>&nbsp; So, likewise, in 1223 (7 Hen. III.), the
Monks of Flaxlegh were directed to have &ldquo;forgiam suam,&rdquo; as in
the time of King John.</p>
<p>A document <a name="citation14c"></a><a href="#footnote14c"
class="citation">[14c]</a> without a date, but unquestionably belonging to
the early part of the reign of Hen. III., to whom it seems to be addressed
by way of an official report on the state of the Forest, affords the
earliest compendium that has been discovered of the extent of its iron
works at this period.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Concerning the &ldquo;Fabricis,&rdquo; these authorities say, that
the Monks of Flaxley have &ldquo;unam fabricam arrantem&rdquo; at Ardland,

forsooth lord of each vill, receives III<sup>d.</sup> any way per week from
each fabrica; and they are sustained by charcoal made in Wallea, and by
perquisites in the Forest.&rdquo;&nbsp; They say, too, that at Ruwardin
there are at one time or other &ldquo;V. fabrica arrantes,&rdquo; and
sometimes less, in the same way as the constable and lord of each vill
take, as aforesaid.</p>
<p>They say also that at Magnam Dene are &ldquo;VIII<sup>to</sup>
fabric&aelig; arrantes&rdquo; of charcoal, made without the Forest bounds;
and the constable and lord of Dene and of Abbenhal take of the above-named
&ldquo;fabric&aelig;&rdquo; as is first of all stated.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>They say also that at Parvam Dene are &ldquo;IIII<sup>or.</sup>
fabric&aelig; arrantes&rdquo; of the perquisites in the Forest, and
sometimes also of charcoal made beyond the Forest bounds, and from thence
the constable and lord of the same will take as has been already said.</p>
<p>They say also that Nigel of Lideneye holds one &ldquo;fabricam,&rdquo;
at Lideneye, &ldquo;arrantem&rdquo; sometimes from the forest, and
sometimes with charcoal made in Wallea, from whence the constable receives
VII<sup>s.</sup> per annum.</p>
<p>They say, too, that Walter de Ewies holds one &ldquo;fabricam arrantem
at Lideneye, from whence in the same manner the constable takes as has been
said before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peculiar interest seems to attach to the above return, not only from its
high antiquity, but also because it gives other instances besides that of
the monks of Flaxley, in which oak trees were granted to individuals for
sustaining their forges.&nbsp; The wording of the report likewise indicates
a new meaning, and, no doubt, the correct one&mdash;of the term
&ldquo;arrantes,&rdquo; as applied to the forges, which it proves to
signify <i>fed</i>, <i>supported</i>, <i>replenished</i>, &amp;c., and not
<i>moveable</i>, as has been heretofore supposed&mdash;a term that seems
singularly appropriate, considering how rapidly charcoal fuel burns away
when urged by a strong blast, and, in consequence, the frequent necessity
of renewing it.&nbsp; Besides which, the forge would have to be repeatedly
fed with fresh charges of ore.</p>
<p>Gloucester was for ages doubtless the market to which a large portion of
the iron made in the Forest of Dean was sent for sale; and so superior was
its <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>quality, that Gloucestria, or Glovernia, hardware was much sought
after.&nbsp; The following letter&mdash;addressed by Simon de Surtiz to
Ralph de Wareham, Bishop of Chichester, 1217-1223, or Ralph Neville, who
held the see 1223-1245, relative to the purchase of iron, affords an
instance of this fact:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have inspected the letters of his Lordship H. de Kynard, sent
to us by you, and which I transmit to your holiness, signifying that he has
taken amiss your command respecting the iron to be bought, writing to you
that x. marks for the one lot of iron, and c. shilling for the other lot,
ought to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore since the same H. has not rightly understood your
command, if it pleases you to write to him, you will that he have made for
you x. marks of inferior iron, supposing he is able to do so.&nbsp; But if
otherwise, then that it be v. marks of the heavier and v. marks of the
lighter sort, and that the kind made at Gloucester is what is wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it please you, write also to the Lord Abbot of Gloucester, so
that he work with care for my Lord of Winchester, your guest, that he be as
easy as he can about the iron, and without delay.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover, my Lord H. de Kynard consults you that the iron may be
wanted at Bristol and not at Gloucester.&nbsp; But if he yield to your wish
I would recommend you that it be brought to Gloucester, as more easy, and
without risk.&nbsp; I await your convenience until you can be brought to
Winchester.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The king&rsquo;s &ldquo;great forge,&rdquo; mentioned above, yielded, in
after years, &pound;26 19s. 3d. to the Custos, but was ere long suppressed,
as detrimental to the Forest woods.&nbsp; Its being named here suggests a
solution of the term &ldquo;levantis,&rdquo; or small, generally given to
the other forges of the district.&nbsp; They were urged, probably, with
such bellows as may be seen carved on an ancient tombstone in Newland
Churchyard.</p>
<p>In the year 1841, when that part of the old road leading up to the
Hawthorns from Hownal was altered, near the brook, below Rudge Farm, the
hearths of five small forges, cut out of the sandstone rock, and curiously
pitched round the bottom with small pebbles, were laid open.&nbsp; An iron
tube, seven or eight inches long, and one inch and a half bore, apparently
the nozzle of a pair of bellows, was also found; as well as scores of old
tobacco-pipes, as they seemed, bits of iron, much rusted, and broken <!--

Forest, the jurors returned that&mdash;&ldquo;the said abbot and convent,

<p>According to this return, there were 60 forges (fabrica) at work in the
district of the Forest at this period.&nbsp; Of these, 19 were situated on
the east side, towards Gloucester; 6 were on the south, towards the Severn;
23 were on the west, towards the Wye; and 12 were on the north, towards
Herefordshire.&nbsp; Hence, they were most numerous on the east and west,
especially the latter, in accordance with the greater extent of the ancient
mine holes on that side.</p>
<p>The annual charge levied by the Crown for each forge was usually at the
rate of 13s. 6d., or a mark.&nbsp; When otherwise&mdash;for in certain
cases it amounted to 20s.&mdash;it arose, probably, from some local
circumstances connected with the quantity or quality of the iron made at
that particular work.</p>
<p>Taken altogether, the forges in the Forest now yielded the king more
than &pound;30 every twelve months.</p>
<p>They were leased for periods varying from three months to twenty years,
although the general length approached much nearer to the shorter limit
than to the longer one.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>By
the same &ldquo;regard,&rdquo; the iron mines are specified as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The jurors say that Ralph de Abenhalo hath a mine in the

jurors say that the foresters take cooper&rsquo;s stuff out of the open
woods from the miners to the inbondage of the miners, and work it for their
own profit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the above curious items it appears that the iron mines, in common
with the forges, were mostly situated on the Wye side of the Forest.&nbsp;
But then the bailiwicks of Little Dean and Ruerdean are not included.</p>
<p>It would appear, too, that the ore was then measured by the bushel, as
it has been ever since, owing, of course, to its loose powdery nature,
which seems, therefore, to have been the sort preferred.</p>
<p>The other singular particulars descriptive of &ldquo;lawe ore,&rdquo;
&amp;c., are noticed elsewhere, in the second portion of this work,
containing the &ldquo;Book of Dennis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another &ldquo;Inquisition&rdquo; exists, bearing date the 12th Edward
II., <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a> but applying to the year commencing with Easter
the 10th Edward II., or thirty-five years later than the former

foresters of fee, and by twelve jurors.</p>
<p>It assigns one &ldquo;fabrica,&rdquo; consuming ten shillings&rsquo;
worth of wood-coal per week, or &pound;24 yearly, to each of the following
persons, located as under:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If this list includes all the forges then at work in the Forest, a
diminution of seventeen had occurred during the last thirty-five years, and
apparently on the west side of the district.&nbsp; Changes may also be
observed to have taken place in the owners, although several names are met
with a second time.</p>
<p>Considerable prosperity and steadiness continued to attend the mining
and making iron in the Forest, so as to render it eligible for the
imposition of tithes.&nbsp; So, on the completion of Newland Church, at
this period, the Bishop of Llandaff, who presented to it, applied for and
obtained from Edward III., in the <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>fourteenth year of his reign, A.D. 1341, a
grant of the tenth part of the ore raised in the neighbourhood, which,
together with the forest forges, yielded a rental of &pound;34 the same
year. <a name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a"
class="citation">[25a]</a></p>
<p>To the Edwardian period, that has now, by the aid of the numerous
records already quoted, been so minutely substantiated, must be assigned
the most prosperous era of the Forest of Dean iron works.&nbsp; A large
portion of such success is to be traced to the celebrity at this date of
the great fair in Gloucester.&nbsp; It began annually on the eve of St.
John Baptist&rsquo;s day, and continued for the five days following.&nbsp;
Agricultural implements were in much request at it, and even noblemen are
said to have attended. <a name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b"
class="citation">[25b]</a></p>
<p>Other places, such as Caerleon, Newport, Barkley, Monmouth, and
Trellech, obtained their supplies of iron, or at least the mine-ore, from
this neighbourhood, the Forest miner having a certain status of his own,
and constituting, with his partners or &ldquo;verns,&rdquo; a guild of
considerable local influence. <a name="citation25c"></a><a
href="#footnote25c" class="citation">[25c]</a></p>
<p>The heraldic crest (p. 67) forming part of a mutilated brass of the
fifteenth century, within the Clearwell Chapel of Newland Church, gives a
graphic representation of the iron miner equipped for his work, if not
actually engaged in it.&nbsp; He is represented as wearing a cap, and
holding between his teeth a candle-<i>stick</i>, an appurtenance still in
use amongst the miners about Coleford, as may be observed by examining the
frontispiece to this volume, thus illustrating the primitive use and
significance of the <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>phrase candle-<i>stick</i>.&nbsp; With the
small mattock in his right hand, he would loosen the fine mineral earth
lodged in the cavity within which he worked, as occasion required, or else
detach the metallic incrustations lining its sides.&nbsp; A light wooden
mine hod, covered, probably, with hide, hangs at his back by a
shoulder-strap, fastened to his belt.&nbsp; His attire is completed by a
thick flannel frock and leathern breeches, tied with thongs below the
knee.&nbsp; The feet most likely were bare.</p>

27</span>Other contemporary representations of the mining implements in use
at this time in the Forest occur at Abbenhall, where the west side of the
church tower, and also the font, exhibit panels carved with hammers,
shovels, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Some persons of considerable experience have concluded that the ore was
washed ere placed in the forge.&nbsp; The mounds of deep red earth that
occur in some parts of the Forest are supposed to establish this
practice.&nbsp; If ever such was the custom, no other trace of it appears,
and it is quite unknown now.&nbsp; In parts of South Wales, water may be
used with advantage, but were it applied to the mineral here, much would be
washed away, because of its finely divided state.</p>
<p>An interval of two centuries and upwards intervenes at this point.&nbsp;
No data for determining the state of the Dean Forest iron works again
occurs until the reign of Elizabeth.&nbsp; For the mean time, however,
there seems every probability that operations went on without intermission,
although some decline had apparently taken place.&nbsp; Perhaps the
dissolution of the monasteries interrupted the works at Flaxley and
Tintern, by causing the discharge of the old hands and the employment of
unskilled operatives in their stead.</p>
<p>The domestic series of the State Papers enable the clue to be resumed
under date 30th June, 1566, when one William Humfrey, upon information
derived from some German miners, addressed a letter &ldquo;to Sir
W<sup>m</sup> Cecill ab<sup>t</sup> the plenty of good iron contained in
the Forest of Dean.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was, no doubt, the general rumour of
this fact that rendered it an object of <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>spoliation to the
would-be invaders from Spain in 1588.&nbsp; At this date, wire, drawn by
strength of hand, is said to have been made at Sowdley.&nbsp; For such kind
of manufacture the Forest iron, from its toughness and ductility, was
admirably fitted, without requiring any essential change in the mode of
reducing the ore, although improved methods of doing so were being adopted
in other parts of the kingdom, particularly in Sussex.&nbsp; That the old
way of working lingered long in the northern counties appears from a
statement of Mr. Wyrrall&rsquo;s, to the effect that &ldquo;The father of
the late Mr. James Cockshut of Pontypool found, some years ago, an old man
working by himself at a bloomary forge in a remote part of Yorkshire.&nbsp;
Being himself well acquainted with every branch of the iron trade and
works, he stayed with the man long enough to investigate and comprehend his
mode of working, and saw him work, with his own hands, a piece of iron from
the ore to the bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earliest intimation of any decided alteration being adopted in the
manner of operating on the raw metal occurs in the terms of a
&ldquo;bargayne&rdquo; made by the Crown &ldquo;w<sup>th</sup> Giles
Brudges and others,&rdquo; <a name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a> on 14th June, 1611, demising &ldquo;libertye to
erect all manner of workes, iron or other, by lande or water, excepting
wyer workes, and the same to pull downe, remove, and alter att
pleasure,&rdquo; with &ldquo;libertye to take myne oare and synders, either
to be used att the workes or otherwise,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; By
&ldquo;synders&rdquo; is meant the refuse of the old forges, but which, by
the new process, <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>could be made to yield a profitable per centage
of metal, which the former method had failed to extract.</p>
<p>Early in the year following (17 Feb. 1612), a similar
&ldquo;bargayne&rdquo; was made with no less a person than William, Earl of
Pembroke, elder brother of Sir Philip Herbert, one of James I.&rsquo;s
earliest favourites.&nbsp; His high position did not prevent him,
therefore, from engaging in manufacture and trade, only in the prosecution
of them he would be made to pay accordingly.&nbsp; Thus, whilst the former
party paid 3s. for each cord of wood, the earl was charged 4s. for 12,000
cords yearly for twenty-one years, or &pound;200 per annum, with &pound;33
6s. 8d. besides, all for fuel only.&nbsp; He was, however, &ldquo;to have
allowance of reasonable fireboote for the workmen out of the dead and dry
wood, and to inclose a garden not exceedinge halfe an acre to every howse,
and likewise to inclose for the necessity of the workes the number of XII.
acres to every severall worke; the howses and enclosures to be pulled downe
and layd open as the workes shall cease or remove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similar appreciation of the remunerative character of iron making occurs
in connection with a still more illustrious person.&nbsp; There exists a
letter, dated 7 May, 1611, addressed by Sir Francis Bacon to Cecil, Lord
Salisbury, endorsed, &ldquo;L<sup>d</sup> Lisle, Sir F. Bacon, and others,
to be preferred in the sale intended in the Forest of Deane for some
reasonable portion of wood, for maintenance of their Wire-works, paying as
any others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter itself runs in these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;It may please your good Lordship,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understanding that his Majesty will be pleased to sell some <!--
page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>good
portion of wood in the Forest of Deane, which lies very convenient to the
Company&rsquo;s Wire Works at Tynterne and Whitebrooke, we are enforced to
have recourse to your lordship, as to our Governor of the said Company,
humbly praying your lordship to afford us some reasonable quantity thereof,
the better to uphold the said works, whereof by information from our
farmers there, we stand in such need, as without your lordship&rsquo;s
favour we shall hardly be able to subsist any long time.&nbsp; We do not
entreat your lordship for any other or more easy price than that your
lordship directs the sale of it to others; only we humbly pray for some
preferment in the opportunity of the place where the woods lie, and in the
quantity, as it may answer in some portion to our wants.&nbsp; Herein, if
your lordship will be pleased to favour us, then we humbly pray your
lordship to direct us to some such persons as your Lordship resolves to
employ in the business.&nbsp; And as we humbly take our leaves of your
lordship,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your lordship&rsquo;s humbly at
command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;London.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What success attended this application, or the enterprise which it was
intended to promote, does not appear.&nbsp; Wealth flowed in from other
quarters, so that the great philosopher was relieved from the necessity of
trying to make money by making iron.&nbsp; Tyntern, however, and also
Whitebrook, have ever since been connected with that kind of
manufacture.</p>
<p>A third &ldquo;bargayne,&rdquo; and corresponding with the two previous
ones, was agreed to on the 3rd May, 1615, with Sir Basil Brook, from whom
rent in kind was thus retained:&mdash;&ldquo;iron, 320 tons p. annum,
w<sup>ch</sup> att xii<sup>ll</sup> x<sup>s</sup> the tonn, cometh to 4000
per an.: the rent reserved to be pay<sup>d</sup> in iron by 40 tonns p.
month, w<sup>ch</sup> cometh to 500<sup>ll</sup> every month; so in toto
yearelye 4000<sup>ll</sup>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A proviso was added that&mdash;&ldquo;The workes already buylt, onlye
grantted w<sup>th</sup> no power to remove them, but bound to mayntayne and
leave them in good case <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>and repayre, w<sup>th</sup> all stock of
hammers, anvils, and other necessarys received att the pattentees&rsquo;
intyre,&rdquo; as also that &ldquo;libertye for myne and synders for
supplying of the workes onlye, to be taken by delivery of the miners att
the price agreed uppon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great confidence was reposed in Sir Basil Brook, since he, with Robert
Chaldecott, obtained a contemporary grant of the office of clerk or
overseer of the iron works in the Forest for fifteen years. <a
name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a>&nbsp; But so much did they abuse it, that ere
three years had elapsed, a commission was issued, 17 July, 1618, to Sir
Thos. Brudnell, Sir John Tracy, Sir William Cooke, and others, <a
name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b" class="citation">[31b]</a>
&ldquo;to survey and examine the wastes made in the Forest of Dean by Sir
Basil Brooke and others, farmers of iron works there.&rdquo;&nbsp; In their
report, one item states that &ldquo;His Majestie, since the erecting the
iron works, had received a greater revenue than formerly.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
were to proceed on interrogatories prepared by Sir Wm. Throgmorton, Bart.,
who was himself engaged in the like manufacture, <a
name="citation31c"></a><a href="#footnote31c" class="citation">[31c]</a>
being associated therein with Sir Sackville Crowe, Bart., John Taylor, and
John Guernsey, of Bristol, merchant farmers of his Majesty&rsquo;s iron
works.&nbsp; Sir Edward and Sir John Winter, of Lydney, and Henry, Lord
Herbert of Ragland, had iron works as well.</p>
<p>In April, 1621, <a name="citation31d"></a><a href="#footnote31d"
class="citation">[31d]</a> Messrs. Richd. Challoner and Phil. Harris,
tenants to Lord Robartes, appear to have succeeded to the works formerly
held by Sir Basil Brook.&nbsp; Within four years, however, one Christ.
Bainbridge obtained judgment against them <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>for cutting down 1200
trees for their own purposes, but they were ultimately pardoned, as
likewise their predecessors, who had become liable for &pound;33,675 16s.
8d.</p>
<p>The name of Sir Edwd. Villiers now appears <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a> as renting iron works in the
Forest; then that of Sir Richd. Catchmay, having Wm. Rowles and Robt.
Treswell for his overseers.</p>
<p>Amidst these successive changes, the only person who seems to have
continued in uninterrupted possession of his works for making iron, was
William Earl of Pembroke, Lord Steward.&nbsp; In 1627 he had the lease of
them renewed to him for twenty-one years.&nbsp; By him, probably, the 610
guns were cast, as ordered by the Crown for the States General of Holland,
A.D. 1629.&nbsp; The spot where they were made was, it would seem, ever
after called &ldquo;Guns Mills,&rdquo; and by which name it is still
known.&nbsp; Guns Pill, on the Severn, was the place, doubtless, where they
were afterwards shipped.</p>
<p>An inventory, unique, probably, in its singularly explicit description
of the buildings and machinery used by the above-named manufacturers, and
bearing the date of 1635, happily came under Mr. Wyrrall&rsquo;s
observation, and was by him carefully transcribed.&nbsp; We learn from it
that the stone body of the <i>furnace</i> now used in the neighbourhood was
usually about 22 feet square, the blast being kept up by a water-wheel not
less than 22 feet in diameter, acting upon two pairs of bellows, measuring
18 feet by 4, and kept in blast for several months together.&nbsp; Such
structures existed at Cannop, Park End, Sowdley, and <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Lydbrook.&nbsp; Besides
which, there were <i>forges</i>, comprising chafferies and fineries, at
Park End, Whitecroft, Sowdley, and Lydbrook.</p>

<p>The same careful investigator (Mr. Wyrrall) of every particular relating
to the iron works of the <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>Forest, formed a glossary of the terms used in
the above specifications, which not only sufficiently explains them, but
also shows that very similar apparatus continued to be used in this
neighbourhood up to the close of the last century.&nbsp; It proceeds
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sows of Iron</i> are the long pieces of cast iron as they run
into the sand immediately from the furnace; thus called from the appearance
of this and the shorter pieces which are runned into smaller gutters made
in the same sand, from the resemblance they have to a sow lying on her side
with her pigs at her dugs.&nbsp; These are for working up in the forges;
but it is usual to cast other sows of iron of very great size to lay in the
walls of the furnaces as beams to support the great strain of the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dam Plate</i> is a large flat plate of cast iron placed on its
edge against the front of the furnace, with a stone cut sloping and placed
on the inside.&nbsp; This plate has a notch on the top for the cinder or
scruff to run off, and a place at the side to discharge the metal at
casting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Shaft</i> of a wheel is a large round beam having the
wheel fixed near the one end of it, and turning upon gudgeons or centres
fixed in the two ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Furnace House</i> I take to be what we call the
casting-house, where the metal runs out of the furnace into the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Bridge</i> is the place where the raw materials are laid
down ready to be thrown into the furnace.&nbsp; I conceive that it had its
name (which is still continued) from this circumstance&mdash;that in the
infancy of these works it was built as a bridge, hollow underneath.&nbsp;
It was not at first known what strength was required to support the blast
of a furnace bellows; and the consequence was that they were often out of
repair, and frequently obliged to be built almost entirely new.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bellows Boards</i>&mdash;Not very different from the present
dimensions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Water Troughs</i>&mdash;scooped out of the solid timber.&nbsp;
This shows the great simplicity of these times, not 150 years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The Hutch</i>, or as it is now corruptly called the Witch, a
wide covered drain below the furnace-wheel to carry off the water from it,
usually arched, but here only covered with timbers to support the rubbish
and earth thrown upon it.</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>&ldquo;<i>Cambs</i> are iron cogs fixed in the shaft to work the
bellows as the wheel turns round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cinder Shovels</i>, iron shovels for taking up the cinders
into the boxes, both to measure them and to fill the furnace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Moulding Ship</i>, an iron tool fixed on a wooden handle, so
formed as to make the gutters in the sand for casting the pig and sow
iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Casting Ladles</i>, made hollow like a dish, with a lip to
lade up the liquid iron for small castings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Wringers</i>, large long bars of iron to wring the furnace,
that is to clear it of the grosser and least fluid cinder which rises on
the upper surface, and would there coagulate and soon prevent the furnace
from working aright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Constable</i>, a bar of very great substance and length, kept
always lying by a furnace in readiness for extraordinary purposes in which
uncommon strength and purchase was required.&nbsp; I suppose this name to
have been given to this tool on account of its superior bulk and power, and
in allusion to the Constable of St. Briavel&rsquo;s Castle, an officer
heretofore of very great weight and consequence in this forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Cinder Hook</i>, a hook of iron for drawing away the scruff or
cinder which runs liquid out of the furnace over the dam plate, and soon
becomes a solid substance, which must be removed to make room for fresh
cinder to run out into its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Plackett</i>, a tool contrived as a kind of trowel for
smoothing and shaping the clay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buckstones</i>, now called Buckstaves, are two thick plates of
iron, about 5 or 6 feet long, fixed one on each side of the front of the
furnace down to the ground to support the stone work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Iron Tempe</i> is a plate fixed at the bottom of the front
wall of the furnace over the flame between the buckstaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tuiron Plate</i> is a plate of cast iron fixed before the
noses of the bellows, and so shaped as to conduct the blast into the body
of the furnace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tuiron Hooke</i>, a tool contrived for conveying a lump of
tempered clay before the point of the tuiron plate, to guard the wall from
wearing away as it would otherwise do in that part, there being the
greatest force of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Shammel Plate</i>, a piece of cast iron fixed on a wooden
frame, in the shape of a 
<a href="images/p39.jpg">
<img alt="Symbol" src="images/p39.jpg" />
</a>, which works up and down as a crank, so as for the camb to lay hold of
this iron, and thereby press down the bellows.</p>
<p><!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&ldquo;<i>Firketts</i> are large square pieces of timber laid upon
the upper woods of the bellows, to steady it and to work it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Firkett Hooks</i>, two strong hooks of square wrought iron
fixed at the smallest end of the bellows to keep it firm and in its
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gage</i>, two rods of iron jointed in the middle, with a ring
for the filler to drop the shortest end into the furnace at the top, to
know when it is worked down low enough to be charged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Poises</i>, wooden beams, one over each bellows, fixed upon
centres across another very large beam; at the longest end of these poises
are open boxes bound with iron, and the little end being fixed with harness
to the upper ends of the firketts are thus pressed down, and the bellows
with it, by the working of the wheel, while the weight of the poises lifts
them up alternately as the wheel goes round.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>As to the length of time these works continued in operation, the late
Mr. Mushet, who knew the district intimately, in his valuable papers on
iron, &amp;c., considered that they were abandoned shortly after the date
of the inventory, <i>i.e.</i> 1635, since, &ldquo;with the exception of the
slags, traces of the water-mounds, and the faint lines of the
water-courses, not a vestige of any of them remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He adds,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;About fourteen years ago I first saw the ruins of one of these
furnaces, situated below York Lodge, and surrounded by a large heap of slag
or scoria that is produced in making pig iron.&nbsp; As the situation of
this furnace was remote from roads, and must at one time have been deemed
nearly inaccessible, it had all the appearance at the time of my survey of
having remained in the same state for nearly two centuries.&nbsp; The
quantity of slags I computed at from 8000 to 10,000 tons.&nbsp; If it is
assumed that this furnace made upon an average annually 200 tons of pig
iron, and that the quantity of slag run from the furnace was equal to
one-half the quantity of iron made, we shall have 100 tons of cinders
annually, for a period of from 80 to 100 years.&nbsp; If the abandonment of
this furnace took place about the year 1640, the commencement of its
smeltings must be assigned to a period between the years 1540 and
1560.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>The oldest piece of cast iron which Mr. Mushet states he ever saw,
exhibited the arms of England, with the initials E. R., and bore date 1555
(?), but he found no specimen in the Forest earlier than 1620.&nbsp; A few
cast-iron fire-backs have been noticed in some of the old houses in the
vicinity of the Forest, but none have an earlier date on them.&nbsp; The
cast-iron grave-slabs found in the ancient iron-making districts of Surrey
and Sussex do not occur here.&nbsp; He also observes that &ldquo;although
he had carefully examined every spot and relic in Dean Forest likely to
denote the site of Dud Dudley&rsquo;s enterprising but unfortunate
experiment of making pig-iron with pit-coal,&rdquo; no remains had been
found.&nbsp; It was the same with the like operations of Cromwell, Major
Wildman, Captain Birch, and other of his officers, doctors of physic and
merchants, by whom works and furnaces had been set up in the Forest at a
vast charge.</p>
<p>The troubles of the civil wars, in which the country surrounding the
Forest was so much involved, materially disturbed its iron
manufactures.&nbsp; Sir John Winter&rsquo;s large works at Lydney were
wholly destroyed, and probably such others as continued in operation were
limited to the casting of cannon and shot, similar to what was used in the
siege of Goodrich Castle by Colonel Birch in 1646.&nbsp; Otherwise iron
making was for the time suppressed.</p>
<p>When matters had become somewhat settled, the attention of the
Commonwealth was directed to them.&nbsp; They were placed under the general
supervision of Major John Wade, who was assisted in their management by
John a Deane.</p>

<p>Hardly had the king&rsquo;s return been effected when, amidst the
innumerable petitions which instantly greeted him, is one from Sir Hugh
Middleton, Bart., for &ldquo;the place of Overseer and Receiver of Profits
of His Majestie&rsquo;s Iron Works in the Forest of Dean.&rdquo; <a
name="citation42c"></a><a href="#footnote42c"
class="citation">[42c]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>He strengthened his application with the timely
remark that the appointment for which he sought was held by Major John
Wade, &ldquo;put in by Cromwell; an officer of which Wade, in July last
(1659), robbed him of horses, arms, &amp;c., kept him four months in close
imprisonment for adhering to His Ma<sup>ty</sup>,<sup> </sup>&amp; has
several times ransacked his house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A contemporary petition, to much the same end, but from a different
quarter, was presented by Sir Edward Massey.&nbsp; He stated, truly enough,
that &ldquo;he had formerly held the works for which he now applied, but
they and all his stock were taken from him by the Rump Parliament for his
loyalty.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he suppressed saying, how they were formerly
voted to him by the House of Commons for defeating the staunch royalist Sir
John Winter, to whom they previously belonged.</p>
<p>Sir John, himself, was a third, and reasonable applicant for the
restoration of his patent for the same, which was as justly restored him;
the other, but unsuccessful candidate, being Sir Baynham Throckmorton.</p>
<p>In an elaborate return, <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a> addressed to the Barons of the Exchequer, and
dated the 12th April, 1662, the question is mooted, &ldquo;What advantages

<p>So considerable a balance each year, from one <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>furnace and a single
forge, admits of comparison with the profits made by ironmasters now.</p>
<p>The Commissioners further report that all necessary appliances existed
on the spot:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One excellent Furnace called the Park Furnace, and one Forge
called Whitecros Forge.&nbsp; The later is in good rep<sup>re</sup>, but
the Furnace wants a Roofe to y<sup>e</sup> Cole hous, and some other
Rep<sup>rs</sup>, w<sup>ch</sup> we compute may cost us circa
40<sup>li</sup>, and care must be taken whensoever his Ma<sup>ty</sup>
shall take them into his own handes, that all the Implem<sup>ts</sup> the
late ps&otilde;ns intrusted w<sup>th</sup> the managem<sup>t</sup> thereof
had deliv&rsquo;d to them by inventory or otherwise, be forthcoming, or
else it will be a great p<sup>r</sup>judice to his
Ma<sup>ty</sup>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was also pointed out that, besides &ldquo;the greate yearely
pfitt&rdquo; likely to accrue to the King, should he take the Iron Works
into his own hands, they were &ldquo;capable to serve his Navey both
w<sup>th</sup> beter Iron and at much Easier Rates then now he payes for
all sorts, and wee conceive that Iron Ordinance might be cast here for
y<sup>e</sup> Service of y<sup>e</sup> Navey also at y<sup>e</sup> same
rates.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of the Forest iron, in the form of iron hoops, had
already found its way to the navy store at Woolwich. <a
name="citation46"></a><a href="#footnote46" class="citation">[46]</a></p>
<p>Even the last winter&rsquo;s great storm (18th of February, 1662) is
made to support their counsels, for the Commissioners affirmed
that&mdash;&ldquo;500<sup>li</sup>, together wi<sup>th</sup> the young
beechen timber lately blowne downe in the Lea Bayley, will sett the workes
a goeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, the same officials suggested that a check should be put to the
practice of sending iron ore and cinder out of the Forest, lest the supply
to the king&rsquo;s <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>works, as proposed, should run short.&nbsp;
They suggest a tax &ldquo;6d. at first, for fifteen bushells,&rdquo; adding
&ldquo;that they were informed that there is carryed out yearly at least
4000 dozen; and there is now lying at Newnham a small vessell to transport
some for Ireland.&nbsp; There must needs be a Prohibition to carry out of
the Forrest any cinders, least his Ma<sup>ty&rsquo;s</sup> owne works
should need them in tyme.&rdquo; <a name="citation47a"></a><a
href="#footnote47a" class="citation">[47a]</a></p>
<p>Reasons so carefully analyzed for inducing the Crown to take in hand
iron making at Park End, deserved a better fate.&nbsp; But the king had
irons enough in the fire, without becoming a manufacturer of iron in the
Forest of Dean.&nbsp; Its timber was rather wanted for the navy, which the
Duke of York longed to render more effective.&nbsp; Besides, places more
convenient of access, in Surrey and Sussex, were supplying the iron
trade.&nbsp; Hence, when in 1683 the above-named proposal was renewed by
Sir John Erule, the Forest supervisor, it was rejected, although he
promised a profit of &pound;5390 per annum. <a name="citation47b"></a><a
href="#footnote47b" class="citation">[47b]</a></p>
<p>The authorities went further than this, in refusing, as they thought, to
sacrifice the timber for the iron.&nbsp; They even directed, about this
time, the demolition of the Forest furnaces, thus reducing its iron works
to such a degree as almost to annihilate them for the next hundred
years.</p>
<p>What their recent state of prosperity had been, Andrew Yarranton, in his
book of novel suggestions <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>for the &ldquo;Improvement of England by Sea
and Land,&rdquo; printed in 1677, describes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And first, I will begin in Monmouthshire, and go through the
Forest of Dean, and there take notice what infinite quantities of raw iron
is there made, with bar iron and wire; and consider the infinite number of
men, horses, and carriages which are to supply these works, and also
digging of ironstone, providing of cinders, carrying to the works, making
it into sows and bars, cutting of wood and converting into charcoal.&nbsp;
Consider also, in all these parts, the woods are not worth the cutting and
bringing home by the owner to burn in their houses; and it is because in
all these places there are pit coal very cheap. . . .&nbsp; If these
advantages were not there, it would be little less than a howling
wilderness.&nbsp; I believe if this comes to the hands of Sir Baynom
Frogmorton and Sir Duncomb Colchester, they will be on my side.&nbsp;
Moreover, there is yet a most great benefit to the kingdom in general by
the sow iron made of the ironstone and Roman cinders in the Forest of Dean,
for that metal is of a most gentle, pliable, soft nature, easily and
quickly to be wrought into manufacture, over what any other iron is, and it
is the best in the known world; and the greatest part of this sow iron is
sent up Severne to the forges into Worcester, Shropshire, Staffordshire,
Warwickshire and Cheshire, and there it&rsquo;s made into bar iron: and
because of its kind and gentle nature to work, it is now at Sturbridge,
Dudley, Wolverhampton, Sedgley, Wasall and Burmingham, and there bent,
wrought, and manufactured into all small commodities, and diffused all
England over, and thereby a great trade made of it; and, when manufactured,
into most parts of the world.&nbsp; And I can very easily make it appear,
that in the Forest of Dean and thereabouts, and about the material that
comes from thence, there are employed and have their subsistence therefrom
no less than 60,000 persons.&nbsp; And certainly, if this be true, then it
is certain it is better these iron works were up and in being than that
there were none.&nbsp; And it were well if there were an Act of Parliament
for enclosing all common fit or any way likely to bear wood in the Forest
of Dean and six miles round the Forest; and that great quantities of timber
might by the same law be there preserved, for to supply in future ages
timber for shipping and building.&nbsp; And I dare say the Forest of Dean
is, as to the iron, to be compared to the sheep&rsquo;s back as to the <!--
page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>woollen;
nothing being of more advantage to England than these two are. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Forest of Dean and thereabouts, the iron is made at this
day of cinders, being the rough and offal thrown by in the Romans&rsquo;
time; they then having only foot blasts to melt the iron stone; but now, by
the force of a great wheel that drives a pair of bellows twenty feet long,
all that iron is extracted out of the cinders, which could not be forced
from it by the Roman foot blast.&nbsp; And in the Forest of Dean and
thereabouts, and as high as Worcester, there are great and infinite
quantities of these cinders, some in vast mounts above ground, some
underground, which will supply the iron works some hundreds of years, and
these cinders are they which make the prime and best iron, and with much
less charcoal than doth the ironstone. . . .&nbsp; Let there be one ton of
this bar-iron made of Forest iron, and &pound;20 will be given for
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 4th &ldquo;Order&rdquo; of the Mine Law Court, dated 27th April,
1680, fixes the prices at which twelve Winchester bushels of iron mine
should be delivered at the following places:&mdash;St. Wonnarth&rsquo;s
furnace, 10s.; Whitechurch, 7s.; Linton, 9s.; Bishopswood, 9s.; Longhope,
9s.; Flaxley, 8s.; Gunnsmills (if rebuilt), 7s.; Blakeney, 6s.; Lydney,
6s.; at those within the Forest (if rebuilt), the same as in 1668;
Redbrooke, 4s. 6d.; the Abbey (Tintern), 9s.; Brochweare, 6s. 6d.;
Redbrooke Passage, 5s. 6d.; Gunnpill, 7s.; or ore (intended for inland)
shipped on the Severn, 6s. 6d.</p>
<p>Most of these localities present traces of long continued iron
manufacture, especially St. Wonnarth&rsquo;s, Whitchurch, Bishopswood, and
Flaxley, where the energetic proprietress, Mrs. Boevey, is said by Sir R.
Atkyns to have had (c. A.D. 1712) &ldquo;a furnace for casting of iron, and
three forges.&rdquo;&nbsp; Charcoal is the only fuel of which any
indications remain, the coppice woods being in several instances preserved
from <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>which it used to be obtained, and the furnaces are shown to have
been invariably situated where waterpower was at command.</p>
<p>The prices affixed to the ore, including delivery, indicate a
discontinuance, in a measure, of the mines on the north-east edge of the
Forest.&nbsp; Those adjoining Newland and in Noxon Park, both on the
opposite side of the Forest, appear to have formed the principal sources of
supply.&nbsp; The records of the Court of Mine Law, belonging to this date,
allude oftener to these works than to others, for the same reason.</p>
<p>Its &ldquo;order,&rdquo; dated 8th December, 1685, in providing that
&ldquo;the one-half of the jury of 48 should be iron-miners, and the other
half colliers,&rdquo; manifests considerable decay in the influence and
number of the former operatives, once so much otherwise.&nbsp; It is
remarkable that the later orders are silent as regards iron, owing to the
suppression of the Forest furnaces.</p>
<p>With respect to the mode now in use of reducing the mine ore, there is
preserved so explicit an account, from the pen of Dr. Parsons, the county
antiquary and naturalist of that age, as to call for its verbatim insertion
here:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The ore and cinder, wherewith they make their iron (which is the
great employment of the poorer sort of inhabitants), &rsquo;tis dug in most
parts of the Forest, one in the bowells, and the other towards the surface
of the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two sorts of ore: the best ore is your Brush ore, of
blewish colour, very ponderous, and full of shiny specks, like grains of
silver; this affordeth the greatest quantity of iron, but being melted
alone, produceth a metal very short and brittle.&nbsp; To remedy this
inconvenience, they make use of another material, which they call cinder,
it being nothing else but the refuse of <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>the ore, after the
melting hath been extracted, which, being melted with the other in due
quantity, gives it that excellent temper of toughness for which this iron
is preferred before any other that is brought from foreign parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After they have provided their ore, their first work is to
calcine it, which is done in kilns, much after the fashion of our ordinary
lime kilns; these they fill up to the top with coal and ore untill it be
full, and so, putting fire to the bottom, they let it burn till the coal be
wasted, and then renew the kilnes with fresh ore and coal.&nbsp; This is
done without any infusion of mettal, and serves to consume the more drossy
part of the ore, and to make it fryable, supplying the beating and washing,
which are to no other mettals; from hence they carry it to their furnaces,
which are built of brick and stone, about 24 foot square on the outside,
and near 30 foot in hight within, and not above 8 or 10 foot over where it
is widest, which is about the middle, the top and bottom having a narrow
compass, much like the form of an egg.&nbsp; Behind the furnace are placed
two high pair of bellows, whose noses meet at a little hole near the
bottom: these are compressed together by certain buttons placed on the axis
of a very large wheel, which is turned round by water, in the manner of an
over-shot mill.&nbsp; As soon as these buttons are slid off, the bellows
are raised again by a counterpoise of weights, whereby they are made to
play alternately, the one giving its blast whilst the other is rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first they fill these furnaces with ore and cinder intermixt
with fuel, which in these works is always charcoal, laying them hollow at
the bottom, that they may the more easily take fire; but after they are
once kindled, the materials run together into an hard cake or lump, which
is sustained by the furnace, and through this the mettal as it runs
trickles down the receivers, which are placed at the bottom, where there is
a passage open, by which they take away the scum and dross, and let out
their mettal as they see occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the mouth of the furnace lyeth a great bed of sand, where
they make furrows of the fashion they desire to cast their iron: into
these, when the receivers are full, they let in their mettal, which is made
so very fluid by the violence of the fire that it not only runs to a
considerable distance, but stands afterwards boiling a great while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After these furnaces are once at work, they keep them constantly
employed for many months together, never suffering the <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>fire to slacken night
or day, but still supplying the waste of fuel and other materials with
fresh, poured in at the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several attempts have been made to bring in the use of the sea
coal in these works instead of charcoal; the former being to be had at an
easy rate, the latter not without a great expence; but hitherto they have
proved ineffectual, the workmen finding by experience that a sea-coal fire,
how vehement soever, will not penetrate the most fixed parts of the ore, by
which means they leave much of the mettal behind them unmelted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From these furnaces they bring the sows and piggs of iron, as
they call them, to their forges; these are two sorts, though they stood
together under the same roof; one they call their finery, and the other
chafers: both of them are upon hearths, upon which they place great heaps
of sea coal, and behind them bellows like those of the furnaces, but
nothing near so large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such finerys they first put their piggs of iron, placing three
or four of them together behind the fire, with a little of one end thrust
into it, where softening by degrees they stir and work them with long barrs
of iron till the mettal runs together in a round masse or lump, which they
call an half bloome: this they take out, and giving it a few strokes with
their sledges, they carry it to a great weighty hammer, raised likewise by
the motion of a water wheel, where, applying it dexterously to the blows,
they presently beat it into a thick short square; this they put into the
finery again, and heating it red hot, they work it under the same hammer
till it comes to the shape of a bar in the middle, with two square knobs in
the ends; last of all they give it other heatings in the chaffers, and more
workings under the hammer, till they have brought their iron into barrs of
several shapes, in which fashion they expose them to sale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All their principal iron undergoes the aforementioned
preparations, yet for several other purposes, as for backs of chimneys,
hearths of ovens, and the like, they have a sort of cast iron which they
take out of the receivers of the furnace, so soon as it is melted, in great
ladles, and pour it into the moulds of fine sand in like manner as they do
cast brass and softer mettals; but this sort of iron is so very brittle,
that, being heated with one blow of the hammer, it breaks all to
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an instance of the considerable extent to which the old cinders
continued to be used in the iron furnaces round the Forest, the following
abstract of <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>an indenture, found in Mr. Wyrrall&rsquo;s collection, and dated
20th October, 1692, may be quoted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Jephthah Wyrall, Gent., to R<sup>d</sup> Avenant, Gent., and John
Wheeler, Gent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Articles for the Sale of 10 thousand doz<sup>n</sup> of cinders,
in certain grounds near Mr. Wyrall&rsquo;s house, called the Correggio, the
Limekiln Patch, the Long Sevens, and the Ockwal Field, if so many could be
found there.&nbsp; The Price, 10 Pence the dozen, or 12 Bushels; 6 to be

and such as should be carried to Blakeney Furnace by the Bushel used
there.&nbsp; To be raised and fitted for carriage by Avenant and
Whealer.&nbsp; To employ no persons in raising the cinders but such as Mr.
Wyrall approves of.&nbsp; Mr. Wyrall to carry yearly as many cinders as he

they sh<sup>d</sup> please till the 10 Thousand Dozens should be raised:
and pay for them yearly on the 1st day of May, and the 1st day of October;
and should leave the ground as level and plain as usually is where cinders
are gotten (which was promising nothing at all).&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to a paper examined by Mr. Mushet, and referring probably to
the year 1720 or 1730, the iron-making district of the Forest of Dean
contained ten blast furnaces, viz., six in Gloucestershire, three in
Herefordshire, and one at Tintern, making their total number just equal to
that of the then iron-making district of Sussex.&nbsp; In Mr.
Taylor&rsquo;s map of Gloucestershire, published in 1777, iron furnaces,
forges, or engines are indicated at Bishopswood, Lydbrook, the New Wear,
Upper Red Brook, Park End, Bradley, and Flaxley.&nbsp; Yet only a small
portion <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>of the mineral used at these works was obtained from the Dean
Forest mines, if we may judge from the statement made by Mr. Hopkinson, in
1788, before the Parliamentary Commissioners, to the effect that
&ldquo;there is no regular iron mine work now carried on in the said
Forest, but there were about twenty-two poor men who, at times when they
had no other work to do, employed themselves in searching for and getting
iron mine or ore in the old holes and pits in the said Forest, which have
been worked out many years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a practice is well remembered
by the aged miners, the chief part of the ore used in the above-named
furnaces having been brought by sea from Whitehaven. <a
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54" class="citation">[54]</a>&nbsp;
Thus Mr. Mushet represents, &ldquo;at Tintern the furnace charge for forge
pig iron was generally composed of a mixture of seven-eighths of Lancashire
iron ore and one-eighth part of a lean calcareous sparry iron ore, from the
Forest of Dean, called flux, the average yield of which mixture was fifty
per cent. of iron.&nbsp; When in full work, Tintern Abbey charcoal furnace
made weekly from twenty-eight to thirty tons of charcoal forge pig iron,
and consumed forty dozen sacks of charcoal; so that sixteen sacks of
charcoal were consumed in making one ton of pigs.&rdquo;&nbsp; This furnace
was, he believes, &ldquo;the first charcoal furnace which in this country
was blown with air compressed in iron cylinders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flaxley was one of the very last places where iron was made in the old
way.&nbsp; The Rev. T. Budge, <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>writing at the commencement of the present
century, says of it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The iron manufactory is still carried on, and the metal is
esteemed peculiarly good; but its goodness does not arise from any
extraordinary qualities in the ore, but from the practice of working the
furnace and forges with charcoal wood, without any mixture of pit-coal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quantity of charcoal required is so considerable that the
furnace cannot be kept in blow or working more than nine months
successively, the wheels which work the bellows and hammers being turned by
a powerful stream of water.&nbsp; At this time (28th Oct. 1802) a cessation
has taken place for nearly a year.&nbsp; Lancashire ore, which is brought
to Newnham by sea, furnishes the principal supply; the mine found in the
Forest being either too scanty to answer the expense of raising it, or when
raised too difficult of fusion, and consequently too consumptive of fuel,
to allow the common use of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the furnace is at work, about twenty tons a week are reduced
to pig iron; in this state it is carried to the forges, where about eight
tons a week are hammered out into bars, ploughshares, &amp;c., ready for
the smith.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though these operations have been long given up, the furnace buildings
removed, and the pools drained in which the water accumulated for driving
the machinery, yet the old people of the neighbourhood still recollect when
the Castiard&rsquo;s Vale, now wholly devoted to the picturesque, resounded
with the noise of engines.&nbsp; A solitary heap of Lancashire iron mine
alone remains to show what was once operated upon at this spot.</p>
<p>The year 1795 marks the period when the manufacture of iron was resumed
in the Forest by means of pit-coal cokes at Cinderford, the above date
being preserved on an inscription stone in No. 1 furnace.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
conductors of the work succeeded,&rdquo; in the <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>words of the late Mr.
Bishop, communicated to the author,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;As to fact, and made pig iron of good quality; but from the rude
and insufficient character of their arrangements, they failed commercially
as a speculation, the quantity produced not reaching twenty tons per
week.&nbsp; The cokes were brought from Broadmoor in boats, by a small
canal, the embankment of which may be seen at the present day.&nbsp; The
ore was carried down to the furnaces on mules&rsquo; backs, from Edge Hill
and other mines.&nbsp; The rising tide of iron manufacture in Wales and
Staffordshire could not fail to swamp such ineffectual arrangements, and as
a natural consequence Cinderford sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attempts still continued to be made from time to time in the
locality, but the want of success, and the loss of large capital, placed
the whole neighbourhood under a ban.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moses Teague was the day-star who ushered in a bright morning
after a dark and gloomy night.&nbsp; Great natural genius, combined with a
rare devotion to the interests of the Forest, led him to attempt a solution
of the difficulty.&nbsp; In this he so far succeeded that he formed a
company, consisting of Messrs. Whitehouse, James, and Montague, who took a
lease of Park End Furnace about the year 1825, erected a large water-wheel
to blow the furnace, and got to work in 1826.&nbsp; Having started this
concern, Mr. Teague, who from constitutional tendencies was always seeking
something new, and considered nothing done while aught remained to do, cast
his eye on Cinderford, which he thought presented the best prospects in the
locality; and after making arrangements with Messrs. Montague, Church, and
Fraser, those gentlemen with himself formed the first &lsquo;Cinderford
Iron Company,&rsquo; the writer joining the undertaking when the
foundations of the buildings were being laid.&nbsp; The scheme comprehended
two blast furnaces, a powerful blast engine still at work, finery, forge,
and rolling-mill, designed to furnish about forty tons of tin-plate per
week, with collieries and mine work.&nbsp; Before the completion of the
undertaking it was found that the outlay so far exceeded their expectations
and means that the concern became embarrassed almost before it was
finished, which, with the then great depression of the iron trade during
the years 1829 to 1832 inclusive, led to the stoppage of the works, which
had continued <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>in operation from November, 1829, till the close of 1832, in which
state they continued to 1835, when Mr. Teague again came to the rescue, and
induced Mr. William Allaway, a gentleman in the tin-plate trade, of
Lydbrook, to form, in connexion with Messrs. Crawshay, another
company.&nbsp; Mr. Teague having retired from the management of the
furnaces, that important post was filled by Mr. James Broad, a man of great
practical knowledge, who for twenty years succeeded in making iron at
Cinderford Furnaces of quality and in quantities which had never been
anticipated.&nbsp; There are now four blast furnaces, three of which are
always in use, and a new blast engine of considerable power is in course of
erection, in addition to the old engine, which has been puffing away for
twenty-eight years.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As narrated in an earlier part of this account, Park End long since
possessed a furnace and forge, though afterwards suppressed in 1674, and
not resumed until 1799, the date of the oldest iron furnace there.&nbsp; It
is situated about half a mile lower down the valley than the former one,
and was carried on by a Mr. Perkins.&nbsp; The Works were eventually sold
to Mr. John Protheroe, and by him disposed of to his nephew, Edward
Protheroe, Esq., formerly M.P. for Bristol, who was likewise the possessor
of several collieries near.&nbsp; In 1824 Mr. Protheroe granted a lease of
the furnace and premises, and also sundry iron mines, to the Forest of Dean
Iron Company, then consisting of Messrs. Montague, James, &amp; Co. This
arrangement continued until 1826, when Messrs. William Montague, of
Gloucester, and John James, Esq., of Lydney, became the sole lessees.&nbsp;
A second furnace was erected by these gentlemen in 1827, as well as an
immense water-wheel of 51 feet diameter and 6 feet wide, said at the time
to be the largest in the kingdom.&nbsp; Two extensive ponds, still
observable, were formed higher up the vale, and <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>connected with the
Works by a canal yet remaining.&nbsp; Little use was made, however, of
these appliances, owing to the general introduction and superior advantages
of steam power.&nbsp; A steam-engine was consequently put up for creating
the necessary blast.&nbsp; Not being found sufficiently powerful to keep
two furnaces in operation, each being 45 feet high, 9&frac12; feet diameter
at the top, 14 feet across at the boshes, and 5 feet diameter at the
hearth, another steam-engine of 80 horse power was erected in 1849; but
owing to a depression in the iron trade, and other causes, the two furnaces
were not then worked together.</p>
<p>A few years after the decease of Mr. Montague, in 1847, Mr. James bought
all his interest in the Works and became the sole lessee, until the year
1854, when he purchased from Mr. Protheroe the fee of the property,
together with all the liabilities of the lease.&nbsp; Since that time the
two furnaces have been occasionally worked together, under the
superintendence of Mr. Greenham, one of the proprietors, the firm still
continuing as &ldquo;The Forest of Dean Iron Company.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
produce upwards of 300 tons of pig-iron per week, consuming in the meantime
350 tons of coke, and 600 tons of iron ore, obtained from the neighbouring
mines at Oakwood and China Eugene; and from the Perseverance and Findall
Mine, on the eastern side of the Forest.&nbsp; These operations give
employment to something like 300 men; and the foundation is now being laid
for another furnace.</p>
<p>Besides its iron furnaces, Park End is the site of Messrs. T. and W.
Allaway&rsquo;s extensive Tin-Plate <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Works, erected at a
large outlay by Messrs. James and Greenham in 1851.&nbsp; They find
employment for some 200 work-people, by whom 500 boxes of tinplate are made
per week.&nbsp; Two-thirds of the iron so used is obtained in the
Forest.</p>
<p>Similar works, only on a larger scale, are carried on at Lydney by
Messrs. W. Allaway and Sons.&nbsp; These are five in number, and bear the
names of The Lower Mill, The Lower Forge, The Middle Forge, The Upper Mill,
and The Upper Forge.&nbsp; About 400 hands are engaged at them, and turn
out about 1,000 boxes of tin-plate every week, besides a quantity of
sheet-iron.&nbsp; The materials supplied to these works from the Forest of
Dean are pig-iron, coal, fire-bricks and clay, fire-stone and fire-sand,
and cordwood for conversion into charcoal.&nbsp; Lydney has long been famed
for its ironworks, which at one time belonged to the Talbot family.</p>
<p><i>Sowdley</i>, in spite of its natural beauties and retired situation,
has been occupied by ironworks since 1565, the ancient family of the
Joneses of Hay Hill conducting them as wire-works drawn by power of
hand.&nbsp; Messrs. Parnell and Co. then took to them; from 1784 to 1804
Dobbs and Taylor carried on the works; Browning, Heaven and Tayer followed
in 1824, and Todd, Jeffries and Spirrin in 1828, converting a part of the
premises into paint and brass works.</p>
<p>In 1837 they were raised to the dignity of blast furnaces by having two
of them erected of the usual size, by Edward Protheroe, Esq., and worked by
him for four years.&nbsp; The late Mr. Benjamin Gibbons purchased them in
1857; and in 1863 his representatives <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>sold them to Messrs.
Goold, by whom they are conducted.&nbsp; At present but one furnace is in
blast, yielding about 20 tons of Forest iron each casting, South Wales coke
being the fuel employed.&nbsp; Eighty hands are engaged at these works.</p>
<p><i>Lydbrook</i> has long been the site of several busy ironworks.&nbsp;
They may be specified as the Upper and Lower; the last of these, situated
near the Wye, was once the property of the Foleys, by whom so many of the
iron works of the beginning of the last century were carried on.&nbsp; More
recently they were in Mr. Partridge&rsquo;s hands, and were worked in
connexion with the furnace at Bishopswood.&nbsp; In 1817 Mr. Allaway leased
them, at which time they comprised three forges, rolling and bar mills, and
tin-house complete, capable of producing from 100 to 150 boxes of tin
plates per week.&nbsp; Now, however, under the able management of the late
Mr. Allaway&rsquo;s sons, the Works yield 600 boxes, sent off by the
Wye.&nbsp; The iron used is chiefly that from Cinderford, as being the best
suited for the purpose.</p>
<p>The Upper Works, formerly the property of Lord Gage, at the time when
the High Meadow Estates belonged to the family, are now owned by Messrs.
Russell, the late Mr. Russell having bought them from the Crown in
1818.&nbsp; His son, Mr. Edward Russell, writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We have since then considerably improved and enlarged them, and
are now employing about 100 hands.&nbsp; We manufacture wire for fencing,
as also for telegraph purposes, of which we can roll from 40 to 50 tons per
week.&nbsp; We likewise make charcoal iron for horse-nails and
smith&rsquo;s work, besides that for agricultural purposes, using the
Cinderford, Shropshire, and Staffordshire iron, especially the
former.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>Other works, resembling those just described, are being carried on
by Mr. James Russell at the Forest Vale Iron Works, near Cinderford.&nbsp;
When perfected, they will employ not less than 60 pairs of hands, and will
supply considerable quantities of iron rods for telegraphic and other wire,
as well as chain-cable iron, the adjoining furnaces affording the requisite
metal.</p>
<p>All the iron ore supplied from this neighbourhood to these different
works is derived from one or other of the following iron mines, whose
present extent may be thus particularized. <a name="citation61"></a><a
href="#footnote61" class="citation">[61]</a></p>
<p>The <i>Shake-mantle</i>, <i>Buckshraft</i>, and <i>St. Annal&rsquo;s</i>
pits, on the <i>eastern</i> side of the Forest, constitute that exceedingly
important range of mining operations, from which the Cinderford furnaces
have long obtained their chief supply of iron ore.&nbsp; These are four in
number, having a height of 43 feet, an extreme breadth of 14 feet, that of
the hearth being 6 feet.&nbsp; They make 500 tons every week of the finest
hot-blast iron.</p>
<p>A peculiar interest attaches to the first of these three pits, owing to
its being the oldest mine still at work in this vicinity, though it dates
no earlier than 1829, so recently has iron mining been resumed in this part
of the district.&nbsp; Buckshraft was begun in 1835-7, and that at St.
Annal&rsquo;s in 1849, each originating in the increasing demand for iron
ore at the adjoining blast furnaces.&nbsp; They all descend to the same
vein of red hematite, as well as to one common &ldquo;level.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This runs from one to the others, almost in a direct line <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>two miles long.&nbsp;
The shafts are severally 70, 160, and 221 yards deep.</p>
<p>Upwards of 36,000 tons of rich ore have been annually obtained from
these iron mines for many years, leaving a transverse area of cavernous
workings about 70 yards wide.&nbsp; But a far greater void was formed by
the old miners, whose holes occur immediately above, and in which a few
scattered tools have been discovered, left behind when operations were
abruptly stopped in 1674, but not before the men had burrowed down some 150
yards.</p>
<p>The natural drainage of these mines being towards the Shake-mantle pit,
a very powerful pumping engine has been put up there, capable of raising
250 gallons of water to the surface at every stroke.</p>
<p>As many as 250 hands are employed in working these valuable iron
mines.</p>
<p>The <i>Westbury-brook</i> iron mine, so called from its situation near
the head of that stream, is one of the most productive pits on the
<i>eastern</i> side of the Forest basin.</p>
<p>It was begun about the year 1837, immediately below &ldquo;the old
men&rsquo;s workings.&rdquo;&nbsp; These proved to be remarkably extensive
and searching, all the ore having been cleared out to a depth, in some
places, of 160 yards.&nbsp; They were also found to contain many ancient
mining implements, such as plank-ladders, shovels, helves, &amp;c., all of
ash, besides leather shoes and mattock heads, left behind probably when the
iron furnaces of the district were suppressed in 1674.</p>
<p>Since 1843 this mine work has been very prosperously conducted by the
agents of the Dowlais Iron Company, whither most of its ore is sent to be
<!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>mixed
and smelted with the ore there, much to the improvement of the iron so
made.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 hands are employed at the Westbury-brook mine pit.&nbsp; The
excavations run north and south for upwards of a mile and a half, their
breadth averaging about 16 yards.&nbsp; They are reached by a shaft 186
yards deep, to the top of which a plunging pump raises 33 gallons of water
at each stroke.</p>
<p>For several years past this iron mine has yielded many thousands of tons
yearly of the finest red hematite ore.&nbsp; A steam-engine of 36 horse
power brings it to the surface.</p>
<p>The <i>Old Sling</i> iron mine, begun in 1838, on the Clearwell Mean,
has long been considered one of the principal mine works on the western
edge of the Forest.&nbsp; Its chief access is by a shaft that descends 105
yards to where the deepest workings begin.&nbsp; These gradually rise, in
accordance with the upward slope of the mine train, until they attain an
area of about 20 acres, leaving some 33 acres unwrought above them, to
where &ldquo;the old men&rsquo;s workings&rdquo; are reached.&nbsp; Such is
the case about 50 yards below the surface, after they had worked over
upwards of seven acres of the mine ore.&nbsp; These excavations were found
to contain some ancient picks and wooden shovels tipped with iron, an
addition not met with elsewhere, but rendered necessary in this instance by
the harder nature of the matrix of the mine ore.</p>
<p>This iron mine has yielded for several years past 1,000 tons of red
hematite ore per month, and employed nearly 100 hands.</p>
<p>Another remunerative iron mine, opened on the western side of the
forest, is the <i>Easter</i> iron mine.&nbsp; <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>It has three shafts
sunk upon it, 100, 113, and 118 yards deep respectively.&nbsp; The first of
these, and the only one in work, at which a light steam-engine of 14 horse
power is used, communicates with &ldquo;the old men&rsquo;s
workings,&rdquo; though none of their tools have been found in them.&nbsp;
About fifty men and boys are employed in this mine, from which upwards of
1,000 tons of ore are procured each month.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Forty other gales of iron ore have been awarded to various parties, and
will no doubt be shortly opened.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No account of the production of iron in the Forest of Dean can be called
complete which does not include some description of the <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>&ldquo;laws and
privileges,&rdquo; the &ldquo;customs and franchises&rdquo; of the original
operatives by whom the mine ore was obtained.&nbsp; As the miners
themselves invariably refer to the &ldquo;Book of Dennis&rdquo; and the
seventeen orders of their court of mine law for all authoritative
information respecting their guild, or fraternity of free minership, the
reader is furnished with the following summary of their contents.</p>
<p>Thus the first-named document begins by specifying the franchises of the
mine locally and personally, meaning its liberties or privileges, as not to
be trespassed against, and consisting apparently in this, that every man
who possessed it, <i>though it is not stated how</i>, might, with the
approval of the king&rsquo;s gaveller, dig for iron ore or coal where he
pleased, not limiting him, as in later times, to the Hundred of St.
Briavel&rsquo;s, but giving as his range the whole county south-west of
Gloucester and as far south as the Severn.&nbsp; There was, too, a right of
way awarded to every mine, although in certain cases &ldquo;forbids&rdquo;
to sell might be declared.</p>
<p>One-third part of the profits of the undertaking belonged to the king,
whose gaveller called at the works every Tuesday &ldquo;between Mattens and
Masse,&rdquo; and received one penny from each miner, the fellowship
supplying the Crown with twelve charges of ore per week at twelve pence, or
three charges of &ldquo;sea coal&rdquo; at one penny.</p>
<p>Timber was allowed for the use of the works above and below ground.</p>
<p>Only such persons as had been born and were abiding in the Forest were
to frequent the mines, in working which the distance of a stone&rsquo;s
throw was <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>always to be kept, and property in them might be bequeathed.</p>
<p>The miners&rsquo; clothes and light are mentioned, as likewise the
standard measure called &ldquo;bellis,&rdquo; and carts and waynes are
prohibited.</p>
<p>It alludes to the &ldquo;court of the wod&rdquo; at the speech before
the Verderers; but more particularly to the debtor court at St.
Briavel&rsquo;s castle or gate, and to the mine court, as regulated by the
constable, clerk, and gaveller, with the miners&rsquo; jury of twelve,
twenty-four, or forty-eight, where all causes relating to the mines were to
be alone heard.&nbsp; Three hands, or three witnesses, were required in
evidence, and the oath was taken with a stick of holly held in the
hand.</p>
<p>The miners of Mitcheldeane, Little Deane, and Ruer Deane are called
&ldquo;beneath the wood.&rdquo;&nbsp; It also appears that at Carlion,
Newport, Barkley, Monmouth, and Tulluh, the manufacture of iron was carried
on by &ldquo;smiths,&rdquo; who were connected with smith holders living in
the Forest, and supplying the ore.</p>
<p>For many ages the mining operations of the Forest and the action of the
miners&rsquo; court seem to have gone on so smoothly, and as a matter of
course, that no notices regarding them occur in the documents of those
times.</p>
<p>With the Restoration, however, and the revival of the ancient rights of
the crown, it was found necessary to resume the sessions of the court of
mine law, under the presidency of Sir Baynham Throckmorton.&nbsp; Thus it
first of all met again on the 16th November, 1663, and continued so to do,
from time to time, for the ensuing Hundred years, passing at different <!--
page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>periods
its seventeen &ldquo;orders.&rdquo;&nbsp; These verdicts are chiefly
remarkable for reducing the area of the miners rights to the Hundred of St.
Briavel&rsquo;s, though they fail to say what constituted <i>free
minership</i> beyond the old definition given in the &ldquo;Book of
Dennis,&rdquo; viz., &ldquo;beene borne and abiding within the castle of
St. Brevill&rsquo;s and the bounds of the Forest as aforesaid.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In 1834 the Government commissioners were informed that it involved birth
from a free father, and working a year and a day in the mines.&nbsp; They
are still a numerous and important fraternity, without whom no new mine
works can be commenced.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p67.jpg">
<img alt="Effigy of a Forest Free Miner" src="images/p67.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Their aspect when accoutered for work is given in the
frontispiece.&nbsp; If compared with their medi&aelig;val appearance, as
displayed in the miners&rsquo; crest, <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>the interval of four
hundred years is scarcely discoverable.&nbsp; Every mining appurtenance is
retained, only somewhat altered in shape, and that, perhaps, not for the
better, be it cap, &ldquo;bellis,&rdquo; or general attire.&nbsp; Only the
beard is absent, but then there are the shoes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p68.jpg">
<img alt="Forest of Dean Iron Miners ready for work" src="images/p68.jpg"
/>
</a></p>
<p>On several occasions they conferred their freedom on the leading gentry
of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; By their orders they also sanctioned the
sinking of <i>pits</i>, as distinguished from <i>levels</i>, extending the
interval between mine and mine from &ldquo;within so much space that
y<sup>e</sup> miner may stand and cast ridding and <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>stones soe farr from
him with a bale as the manner is,&rdquo; to five hundred yards.&nbsp; At
the present time the deputy gaveller, Mr. T. Forster Brown, is the resident
official under the Commissioner in charge of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Woods,
&amp;c., and he, with his respected predecessor, have at all times most
obligingly facilitated the author&rsquo;s inquiries by giving the desired
information.&nbsp; It was during the deputy gavellership of the late Mr.
John Atkinson at Coleford that the writer chanced to meet with the original
transcript, here presented to the reader, of the &ldquo;Book of
Dennis.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first printing and publication of it took place in
1687, by William Cooper, at the Pelican, in Little Britain, and it has been
frequently but imperfectly reprinted.</p>
<p>Finding on examination that the reign of the first of the Edwards, and
not the third, was the period to which it assigned the confirmation of the
Forest of Dean Mine Laws, and that it contained many other inaccuracies, he
determined to prepare, in accordance with the valued suggestion of Mr.
Smirke, Judge of the Stannaries of Cornwall, a true copy of so ancient and
curious a document.</p>
<p>From the note which is appended to it, the existing MS. is evidently the
only authentic copy of the original &ldquo;parchment roll,&rdquo; out of
which it was transcribed by the gaveller, Richard Morse, A.D. 1673, of the
penmanship of which period it is a good specimen.</p>
<p>It seems to be a presentment of the Court of Mine Law, duly signed by
the jury of forty-eight free miners.&nbsp; Although its early date, and one
or two forms of expression, may seem to indicate that it was first of all
written in Latin, yet so many of its words <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>and phrases, together
with its concluding signatures, are so thoroughly old English, as to show
that it was most probably composed in our own language.&nbsp; There are no
paragraphs nor punctuations.</p>
<p>In character it is &ldquo;sui generis,&rdquo; though it exhibits traces
of resemblance to the laws and customs of the old mining districts of
Somerset and Derbyshire, and even with those of Germany, as the
accompanying notes show.&nbsp; The words between brackets do not occur in
the original MS., having been inserted by modern printers.&nbsp; Those in
italics give the corrections needed in modern copies.</p>

process of distress, Mr. Smirke states that it is abundantly countenanced

not the first claimant is entitled to preference.</p>
<p><a name="footnote75c"></a><a href="#citation75c"
class="footnote">[75c]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Smirke has discovered that a like
obligation was imposed on the Irons, or Iron Miners, of the forests in the
ancient Earldom of Namur.&nbsp; He very plausibly suggests that the
appellation, &ldquo;Verus,&rdquo; by which the Dean Forest Miners designate
each other, is derived from the word Firon.</p>
<p><a name="footnote75d"></a><a href="#citation75d"

the landowner in the discovery and working of mines; the <i>droit de

miners.</p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
